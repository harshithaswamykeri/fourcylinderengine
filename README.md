# fourcylinderengine
A 4-cylinder engine model with 
pistons, 
piston rings, 
crankshafts, 
connecting rods, connecting rod caps,
and piston pins that burn fuel to generate motion was included. 
Extruded boss/base, revolved boss/base, extruded cut, mirror, fillet, plane, chamfer, linear pattern, chamfer, move, and a copy was used to create part drawings of pistons, 
piston rings, crankshafts, connecting rods, engine cylinders, connecting rod caps, and piston rings. 
The parts were assembled using mate relations, and a basic motion study was performed with a 50 RPM motor.
